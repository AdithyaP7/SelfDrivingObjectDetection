# SelfDrivingObjectDetection

The aim of this project is to build and AI tool that can help Self Driving Cars "see" and pick up on objects that are on the road and classify them into different cateogries of what could be on the road.

Understanding Our Task:
We'll start by understanding our problem, identifying:

What are potential benefits of self-driving cars?

- More Convenient For Drivers who are distracted easily by other devices; their full attention doesn't need to be on the road.
- More Environmentally friendly as self driving cars will not drive erratically by acclerating and breaking hard as this kind of behavior leads to more emmisions by a car
- Very Efficient Self Driving Algorithms can prevent human errors that cause accidents, problems that are both hazardous and very inconvient on a day to day basis

How do self-driving cars work?
- Autonomous cars create and maintain a map of their surroundings based on a variety of sensors situated in different parts of the vehicle. Radar sensors monitor the position of nearby vehicles. Video cameras detect traffic lights, read road signs, track other vehicles, and look for pedestrians.
- For this project, we will focus on the video camera aspect
